### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 Part 2

      My favorite lab was Lab 4 Part 2 The lab involved using floating point numbers to develop a 
      tool that could convert units. I enjoyed creating something that was has real world applications. 
      I also thought it was interesting how computers could display and store significant figures. 



* Lab 5 Part 1

      I also enjoyed Lab 5 Part 1. The lab gave me a better understanding of code reusability. 
      The lab allowed me to adapt the functions in order to calculate the measurements of a 
      rectangle. It also introduced me to the idea of organizing code into separate files, each 
      with a separate purpose. Using Makefiles to test my code was somewhat frustrating because 
      it forced you to find the small mistakes in your code. However it ultimately gave me 
      a sense of satisfaction when I was able to compile without errors.



* Lab 3 

      I thought Lab 3 Part 1 was interesting because it was a exercise in 
      implementing algorithms to solve a problem. In the lab, we had to create 
      a tool that convert different historical calendars  It showed how Computer 
      Science could have applications outside of mathematics and science.
